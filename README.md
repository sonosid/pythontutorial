Introduces python programming 
  - If you have python installed these programs can be run by:
          <path to the python interpreter> <filename>
  
  - For eg: if your filename is hello.py then you would do:
      /usr/bin/python3 hello.py
    Here /usr/bin/python3 is the path where python is installed on my system.

  - An alternative to the above is to add the line #! /usr/bin/python3 to the
    top of your script. This tells where the interpreter is to be found. So 
    when you run the program, you can just type hello.py to run it without 
    the need to type the entire path everytime.
